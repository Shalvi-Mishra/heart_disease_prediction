# Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters. By leveraging data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification algorithms, this model helps in early detection and risk assessment of heart disease.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains several medical parameters such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and other vital indicators. The dataset is either sourced from the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** or a custom dataset.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- TensorFlow/Keras (if deep learning is involved)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run `Heart_disease_prediction.ipynb` step by step.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project includes:
- Data cleaning & handling missing values
- Feature selection & correlation analysis
- Visualizing trends using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
The project implements multiple classification models, such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks (if applicable)

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve & AUC Score

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Deploy the model using Flask/Django API
- Improve accuracy using ensemble learning
- Integrate real-time health data from wearable devices
